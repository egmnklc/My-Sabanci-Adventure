 * ! Djakstra's Algorithm
 * * - Dijkstra’s algorithm calculates shortest paths from a given vertex to all the other vertices.
 * *
 * * Partition of nodes into two sets
 * * → Known nodes
 * *    ⇒ Minimum distance from the initial node is known.
 * * → Unknown nodes
 * *    ⇒ Minimum distance from the initial node is unknown, at least, not finalized.
