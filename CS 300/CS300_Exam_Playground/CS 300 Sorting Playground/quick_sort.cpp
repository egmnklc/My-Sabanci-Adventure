 * ! Quicksort
 * * - The element is in its sorted position if all the elements before it are smaller and all the elements after it are greater.
 * * will study relation olacak
 * * Parititioning
 * * - You interchange pivots when you find the new pivot.
 * * - Right after perform quicksort recursively on both left and right side of the element.
 * * - For Partitioning algorithm, see 2022-12-27-00-43-56.png.
 * * - For QuickSort algorithm, see 2022-12-27-00-47-17.png.
 * * - Fastest known sorting algorithm, average running time: Ο(N×logN)
 * * - Worst case time: Ο(N²)
 * * - Like Mergesort, quicksort is a conquer and divide algorithm as well.
