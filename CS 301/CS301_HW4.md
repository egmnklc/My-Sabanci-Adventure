# Question 1:

> We can construct a flow network with 4 nodes and edges with capacities of 1 to achieve the goal.
> 
> V: s, a, b, t
> 
> E: (s,a), (s,b), (a,t), (b,t)
> 
> c: Each edge has a capacity of 1
> 
> We can show two different max-flow functions for this network:
> 
> ___Flow 1:___ (s,a)=1, (a,t)=1, (s,b)=0, (b,t)=0, max-flow=1
>
> 
> ___Flow 2:___ (s,a)=0, (a,t)=0, (s,b)=1, (b,t)=1, max-flow=1
Thus, for the above network, the max-flow is not unique.

# Question 2:

> Consider the following flow network with 4 nodes:
>
> V: s, a, b, c, d, t
> 
> E: (s,a), (s,c), (a,d), (a,b), (b,t), (c,d), (d,t)
> 
> c: (s,a)=6, (s,c)=4, (a,d)=3, (a,b)=8, (b,t)=6, (c,d)=7, (d,t)=7
> 
> We can find two max-flow functions for this network:
>
> ___Flow 1___: (s,a)=6/6, (s,c)=4/4, (a,d)=2/3, (a,b)=4/8, (b,t)=4/6, (c,d)=4/7, (d,t)=6/7
> 
> ___Flow 2___: (s,a)=6/6, (s,c)=4/4, (a,d)=0/3, (a,b)=6/8, (b,t)=6/6, (c,d)=4/7, (d,t)=4/7
Therefore, even though all edge capacities are different, the max-flow function is not unique, and it disproves `Claim A, so Claim A is false.` 

# Question 3:

> F is not guaranteed to be a flow on G.
> 
> Consider the following simple flow network with 3 nodes and capacities as stated:
> 
> V: s, a, t
> 
> E: (s,a), (a,t)
> 
> c: (s,a)=1, (a,t)=2
> 
> Let f1 and f2 be two flow functions such that:
> 
> f1(s,a)=1, f1(a,t)=1,
> 
> f2(s,a)=1, f2(a,t)=2
> 
> 
> `Define F(u,v) = f1(u,v) + f2(u,v)` 
> : Therefore:
> : * F(s,a) â‡’ 1 + 1 = 2 and F(a,t) = 1 + 2 = 3.
> 
> Here, we have a capacity constarint problem because the sum of the flows exceed the capacity of edges. So, `No, F is not guaranteed to be a flow on G.`
