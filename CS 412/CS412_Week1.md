> Supervised Learning
> * Learns from LABELLED samples to build o model that can make predictions about future instances.
> * We train a model with labeled data, so called using a training set.
> * Given a set of feature/label pairs, find a rule that predicts the label associated with a previously unseen input. 
> *  Have label on it. {: #important}

> ML Algorithm vs ML Model
> * Feature Extraction
> 
> Features are converted into a matrix format.

> Training Set is a set of (x, y) pairs. y is the desired target label given by teacher.

> Classification: Label y is a category or True or False
> * Gender classification
> * Spam classification
> * Cat vs Dog classification
> * Plant classification

> Regression test: Label y is a scalar
> * Credit scoring
> * Sales prediction
